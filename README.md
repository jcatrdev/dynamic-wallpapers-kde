# Dynamic wallpapers for KDE Plasma
This repo contains dynamic wallpapers from MacOS, converted to work on KDE Linux. This is for my personal usage only.

# How to use?
Simply download what you want here and use it.

# Vice-versa?
No, it's not compatible with MacOS. It will only work in KDE.

# Requirements
In order for these wallpapers to work, make sure you have this KDE plugin:
- **Dynamic Wallpaper** - https://github.com/zzag/plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic

# Virus?
You can check it via uploading here: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload
